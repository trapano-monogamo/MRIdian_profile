1. [x] create plot PNGs
2. [ ] rename profile/scan terminology
3. [x] check inflection points are stored correctly
4. [x] check all graphs
	a. isolate peaks in AVARAGE_SYMMETRISED and take the two middle ones, they will be min and max for sure.
	b. implement median filter algorithm (localized filter with intersection mean-data)
5. [x] store and filter important fields (depth, crossplane, ...)
6. [x] substitute data files (10x10 is missing in the old files, it's present in the new ones)
7. [x] create console logs to keep track of the program execution
8. [x] add comments
9. [ ] put legends and right units in plots axis

10. [ ] refactor inflection_points storing and plotting
11. [ ] figure out why sanpietro_symmetrised.txt is missing scan at 24x24 2.0cm

12. [ ] TestSettings -> ProcessingSettings
